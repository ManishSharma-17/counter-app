get the all html elments that we gonna use in the progranming.
create a function for:
    add EventListener to the addOne button for changing the innerHTML of counting elment (p), adding one in the existing value.
now create another function for:
    add EventListener to the save button for changing the innerHTML of storeCounting elment (p).
        if we adding value at the first time only then replace the storeCounting elment (p) innerHTML with counting elment (p).
        after first time rest of the value will add with comma (,) and 0 shouldn't be print inside of the storeCounting elment (p).

for that task we need to know very well about:
    function
    addEventListener
    documentObjectModel
    operators
    if else conditions
